## Problem 2

#### Use the `list.files` to create datafrane of file names

``` r
arms_df = 
  tibble(
    files = list.files(path = "data", full.names = TRUE)
    ) 
```

#### Data cleaning and tidying

``` r
tidy_arms_df = 
  arms_df %>% 
  mutate(
    participant_data = map(files, read_csv), # Read in each subject's data from the csv file
    arm_group = ifelse(str_detect(files, "exp"), "Experimental", "Control"), 
    # Determine the arm group from file name
    subject_id = as.factor(str_extract(files, "\\d+"))
  ) %>% 
  unnest(participant_data) %>%  # unnest the participant data into rows
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8, 
    names_to = "week", 
    values_to = "measurements"
  ) %>% #transform the week columns into a "long" format
  mutate(week = parse_number(week)) # convert the week identifier to a numeric value
```

#### Spaghetti plot to visualize measurements for each participant across different time points

``` r
tidy_arms_df %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = week, y = measurements, group = subject_id, color = subject_id)
    ) + # ensure lines are drawn for each subject
  geom_line(alpha = 0.6) + # set transparency to distinguish overlapping lines
  facet_wrap(.~ arm_group) + # use facet_wrap to separate the arm groups into different panels
  labs(
    title = "Participant Measurements Over the Study Period by arms group",
    subtitle = "Each line represents a single participant's measurements over time",
    x = "Week",
    y = "Measurement",
    color = "Subject ID"
  )
```

#### Plot Description and comparison between groups

- The control group does not show a clear trend over time; the lines
  fluctuate up and down without a consistent direction. While, the
  experimental group seems to show a slight upward trend as time
  progresses.
- The experimental group appears to have higher overall measurements
  compared to the control group. While the control group measurements
  are more clustered.
- The experimental group’s lines show more divergence as time
  progresses, suggesting a possible effect of the experimental
  conditions leading to greater individual differences in outcomes.

## Problem 3

#### Set up design elements and functions

``` r
# Set up
sim_output = vector("list", length = 5000)

for (i in 1:5000) {
  sim_output[[i]] = broom::tidy(
    t.test(
      rnorm(n = 30, mean = 0, sd = 5), mu = 0, conf.level = 0.95
      )
    )
}

# Create the dataframe
sim_output_df =
  bind_rows(sim_output) %>%
  select(estimate = estimate, p_value = p.value)

sim_output_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 5,000 × 2
    ##    estimate p_value
    ##       <dbl>   <dbl>
    ##  1    0.412  0.629 
    ##  2    0.664  0.368 
    ##  3    0.551  0.534 
    ##  4    0.567  0.487 
    ##  5   -1.65   0.0599
    ##  6    1.19   0.229 
    ##  7    0.334  0.738 
    ##  8   -1.19   0.209 
    ##  9    0.122  0.887 
    ## 10    0.684  0.472 
    ## # ℹ 4,990 more rows

#### Repeat
